Here we uploaded R scripts and Rdata used to analyse the relationship between LASV infection (PCR+ = active; Igg+ = past) and host immunogenetics (MHC alleles/supertypes) 

Each script thematically deals with different aspects of the pipeline from the ACACIA output (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.13290 - github: https://gitlab.com/psc_santos/ACACIA) to the final plots

A description of the analysis can be found in the associated publication: Regional Lassa virus lineages select for divergent MHC-I repertoires in _Mastomys natalensis_ Rodents (in review) Olayemi et al. 

The repository induces the nucleotide and amino acid MHC sequences
